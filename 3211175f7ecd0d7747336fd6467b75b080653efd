Phase 3: SHARED-SETUP.org Infrastructure

Prompts used (cleaned for clarity):
1. 'Create a SHARED-SETUP.org that creates directories for change-requests/, experiments/, and research/ as well as core commands for Claude'
   - Purpose: Establish Claude command infrastructure and workflow directories

2. 'Read and tangle the following file: SHARED-SETUP.org'
   - Purpose: Extract Claude commands and templates from org-mode source

Context from original development:
- User showed existing defrecord commands as examples
- Adapted command patterns for Gemini REPL's ClojureScript/formal-methods context
- Created 8 Claude command definitions
- Added templates for structured workflows

Implementation Notes:
- Some files didn't tangle properly (org-babel missed some blocks)
- Manually created missing files to ensure completeness
- Kept SHARED-SETUP.org for v003 (goal: ship only org files that fully tangle)
- Pre-commit hook caught multiple missing trailing newlines (echo >> to the rescue\!)

Files created:
- .claude/commands/ with 8 command markdown files
- Templates for change-requests, experiments, and research
- check-naming.sh script for enforcing naming conventions
