# EXP-001-Expect-Testing

**Date Started**: 2025-07-15
**Status**: Complete

## Hypothesis

We can create comprehensive REPL tests using expect scripts that verify both command processing and API interactions.

## Goals

1. Create expect scripts for all REPL commands
2. Test multi-turn conversations
3. Verify error handling

## Method

Use TCL expect to script REPL interactions and verify outputs.

## Implementation

Created `scripts/test-repl.exp` with basic test coverage.

## Results

### What Worked
- Basic command testing (/help, /exit, etc.)
- Simple interaction verification
- Exit code checking

### What Didn't Work
- Async API response timing is tricky
- Need careful timeout management
- Hard to test error scenarios

## Conclusions

Expect scripts are useful for smoke testing but unit tests are better for comprehensive coverage.

## Next Steps

1. Expand expect scripts for regression testing
2. Consider pexpect for Python-based testing
3. Add CI integration for expect tests
