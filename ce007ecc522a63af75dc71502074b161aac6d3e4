Deviation: Created REPRODUCTION-NOTES.org

Purpose: Track learnings and sequencing issues discovered during reproduction
- Separate from GEMINI-REPL-PROMPTS.org to preserve original prompts
- Documents FreeBSD-specific requirements (gmake)
- Records org-mode tangling inception issue and markdown solution
- Tracks what's working vs waiting on future phases

Implementation detail: Had to use 'echo >> file' to add trailing newline
for pre-commit hook satisfaction - the simple solutions are often best\!
