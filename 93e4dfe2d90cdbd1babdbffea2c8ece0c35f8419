Phase 4: NODE-SETUP.org Development Environment

Prompts used (cleaned for clarity):
1. 'Read then tangle the following file: NODE-SETUP.org'
   - Purpose: Extract ClojureScript development environment from org-mode

2. 'npm install to install Shadow-CLJS dependencies'
   - Purpose: Install Node.js dependencies (skipped for reproduction exercise)

3. 'Remove NODE-SETUP.org after successful tangling'
   - Purpose: Clean up after extraction (kept for v003)

Implementation Notes:
- Created complete ClojureScript REPL implementation in core.cljs
- Added package.json, shadow-cljs.edn, and test infrastructure
- Updated Makefile with comprehensive targets (using gmake compatible)
- Created setup-dev.sh and test-repl.exp scripts
- Massive trailing whitespace cleanup required (FreeBSD sed -i '')
- Pre-commit hook continues to enforce newline discipline\!

Files created:
- package.json with Shadow-CLJS dependencies
- shadow-cljs.edn for ClojureScript compilation
- src/gemini_repl/core.cljs with full REPL implementation
- test/gemini_repl/core_test.cljs with basic tests
- Comprehensive Makefile replacing simple version
- Development helper scripts
