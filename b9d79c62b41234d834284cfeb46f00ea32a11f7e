Phase 11: Conversation Context Implementation

Problem context:
- Each prompt currently sent in isolation
- Follow-up questions fail
- Pronouns like 'that', 'it' don't resolve

Prompt used (cleaned for clarity):
'OK, smallest possible change to implement that then run through some simple tests'
- Add conversation-history atom to track messages
- Modify make-request to include full conversation history
- Add user messages to history before sending
- Add model responses to history after receiving
- Add /context command to display current conversation

Implementation Notes:
- Conversation history already implemented in core.cljs
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Added tests for conversation management
- This enables multi-turn dialogues
- Forms foundation for memetic evolution
- More trailing whitespace battles (11 lines in test file\!)

Key insight: This feature is critical for the self-modification vision -
the REPL can learn from conversation patterns\!
