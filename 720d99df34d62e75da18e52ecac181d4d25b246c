Phase 2: SETUP.org Generation and Tangling

Prompts used (cleaned for clarity):
1. 'Check git status then tangle SETUP.org'
   - Purpose: Extract all project structure from org-mode literate programming file

2. 'Commit the differences from setup.org tangling then remove it'
   - Purpose: Commit generated structure and clean up the setup file

3. 'Use --trailer format for co-author attribution'
   - Purpose: Maintain consistent commit attribution

4. 'No generated with in the body of commits'
   - Purpose: Keep commit messages clean and professional

Implementation Notes:
- Created comprehensive SETUP.org with all project directories and initial files
- Used markdown format for README files (not org) to avoid tangling issues
- Added :mkdirp yes to all source blocks for automatic directory creation
- Alternative approach: Could use pandoc to convert markdown to org after tangling
  Example: find . -name 'README.md' -exec pandoc -f markdown -t org -o {}.org {} \;
- Successfully tangled 14 code blocks creating full project structure
- Removed SETUP.org after successful extraction
