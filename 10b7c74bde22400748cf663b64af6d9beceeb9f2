Phase 6: Project Documentation and Structure

Actions taken:
1. Create comprehensive README.org with:
   - Detailed project description
   - Installation instructions with prerequisites
   - Usage examples and command reference
   - Development workflow documentation
   - Configuration guide
   - Formal verification information
   - Contributing guidelines

2. Add MIT LICENSE file

3. Create CLAUDE.md for AI context with:
   - Build and test commands
   - Code style guidelines
   - Project structure overview
   - Common tasks and workflows
   - BSD-specific notes (gmake)

4. Verify Makefile has all required targets

Implementation Notes:
- Pre-commit hook struck again - needed trailing newlines on ALL THREE files!
- The echo >> saga continues with tears
- Documentation emphasizes this is a reproducible build exercise
- Included notes about literate programming approach
