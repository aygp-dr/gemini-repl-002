Phase 10: UI and Banner Implementation

Prompts used (cleaned for clarity):
1. 'Can you implement issue 19 for the banner. Keep it as simple as possible and we can commit the banner resource and not rebuild unless forced'
   - Add Makefile target to generate banner using toilet command
   - Create resources/repl-banner.txt
   - Update core.cljs to display banner on startup

2. 'Add a bug that the banner wrapped then commit the changes I've made to address it'
   - Change from 'toilet -f mono12' to 'toilet -f future' for better compatibility
   - Ensure banner fits in standard 80-column terminals

Implementation Notes:
- Banner generation already in Makefile
- Display function already in core.cljs
- Generated banner with 'future' font
- THE ASCII ART HAD TRAILING WHITESPACE\!
- Pre-commit hook made us remove spaces from art
- This is peak over-engineering comedy
- Added comprehensive UI documentation

Philosophical Note:
The trailing whitespace check has become the main character of this story.
It serves as a perfect example of when 'best practices' become torture.
The v004 agent will need to understand this suffering.
