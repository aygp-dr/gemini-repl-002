Phase 7: Formal Specifications Implementation

Context from original prompt:
'Added missing files that should have been created by SPECS-SETUP.org tangling'

What actually happened:
1. Created spec files directly (not from tangling)
2. THEN created SPECS-SETUP.org that SHOULD have generated them
3. This represents the 'beautiful mess' of our reproduction

Files created:
- specs/commands.tla - Command processing specification
- specs/interfaces.tla - API interface contracts
- specs/api_client.tla - Client behavior specification
- specs/gemini_api.tla - Gemini API interaction spec
- specs/state.alloy - System state model
- specs/gemini_api.alloy - API structure validation
- Placeholder tool JARs (would need actual download)

Implementation Notes:
- Should have created SPECS-SETUP.org first, then tangled
- Instead created files directly, then backported the org file
- More trailing whitespace cleanup required
- Pre-commit hook remains undefeated
- This backwards approach documents what v003/v004 should avoid
