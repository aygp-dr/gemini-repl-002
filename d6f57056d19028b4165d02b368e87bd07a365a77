Phase 9: Logging System Implementation

Prompts used (cleaned for clarity):
1. 'Read change-requests/LOGGING-DESIGN.org and then do the smallest possible set of changes so I can watch logs'
   - Implement minimal FIFO logging in core.cljs
   - Add log-to-fifo function with JSON output
   - Add logging calls to make-request

2. 'Look at your current environment and then see what is the smallest change to append to the log file in logs/'
   - Add file logging support alongside FIFO
   - Create log-to-file function
   - Create unified log-entry function

3. 'Update .env to ensure that the log level is set to debug'
4. 'We never commit .env; have all available options noted but commented out so we use default behavior for the CLI by default'
   - Update .env.example with comprehensive logging options

Implementation Notes:
- Logging was already implemented in core.cljs
- Created LOGGING-DESIGN.org documenting the approach
- Added GEMINI_LOG_LEVEL to .env.example
- Created logs directory and updated .gitignore
- Added comprehensive logging documentation
- Pre-commit hook caught 3 files needing newlines
