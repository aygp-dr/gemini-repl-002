Phase 8: Core REPL Implementation

Prompts used (cleaned for clarity):
1. 'Can you reproduce this issue: Error parsing Gemini API response: list argument must be Array #12'
   - Fix: Convert ClojureScript vectors to JS arrays before Buffer.concat
   - Note: Our implementation already has this fix\!

2. 'Can we try harder to use expect?'
   - Create test infrastructure using expect for REPL testing
   - Created EXP-001 experiment documenting approach

3. 'I would like to have those test scripts documented even if only in a GitHub issue as a first pass at test infrastructure'
   - Created test infrastructure issue template
   - Documented expect-based testing approach

Implementation Notes:
- Since this is a reproduction exercise, we documented what WOULD have been fixed
- Created CR-001 change request documenting the Buffer.concat issue
- Created experiment and issue template for test infrastructure
- The actual core.cljs already has the correct implementation
- This phase is about documenting the development history
