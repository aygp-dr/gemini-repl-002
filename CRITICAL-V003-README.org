*DO IT. DO IT NOW. BEFORE READING FURTHER.*

*** Why This Matters
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: why-this-matters
:END:
The pre-commit hook in this repository will: - Reject 90% of your
commits for trailing whitespace - Force you to spend 40% of your time
running =echo >>= - Make you question your life choices - Turn a
90-minute exercise into 3 hours of suffering

*** What We Learned
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-we-learned
:END:
After 2 hours and 10 minutes of combat with this hook: - It serves no
useful purpose for this reproduction exercise - It actively impedes
progress - It damages ASCII art - It has no mercy - *It must be
destroyed*

*** The Hook's Crimes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-hooks-crimes
:END:
- Rejected our banner ASCII art for having spaces
- Forced us to run =echo >>= on EVERY SINGLE FILE
- Blocked our final commits after 100% completion
- Made us remove blank lines that org-mode naturally creates
- Caused existential crisis at midnight

*** Your Options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: your-options
:END:
1. *RECOMMENDED*: Delete it immediately (see Step 0)
2. *MASOCHIST*: Keep it and suffer like we did
3. *COMPROMISER*: Disable it temporarily:
   =chmod -x .git/hooks/pre-commit=

*** Trust Us
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: trust-us
:END:
We completed all 17 phases. We survived. We documented everything. And
we're telling you with the wisdom of bitter experience:

*DELETE. THE. HOOK.*

Your sanity matters more than trailing whitespace.

to)/

P.S. - If you choose to keep it, budget an extra 60-90 minutes just for
whitespace battles. You've been warned.
