Phase 1: Repository Foundation

Prompts used (cleaned for clarity):
1. 'Create a .envrc file that loads the .env file if it exists'
   - Purpose: Enable direnv to automatically load environment variables

2. 'Initialize this repository then read SETUP.org for the next steps'
   - Purpose: Create git repository and prepare for structured setup

3. 'Use README.org format'
   - Purpose: Establish org-mode as documentation standard

4. 'Commit the current simple structure supporting environment configuration and document the prompts used'
   - Purpose: Create initial commit with environment support

5. 'Use --trailer format for co-author attribution'
   - Purpose: Follow conventional commit standards with proper attribution

Foundation Technology Vision:
- Simple ClojureScript console application with REPL-style Gemini API interaction
- Slash command structure for user commands (/help, /exit, /clear)
- Formal methods to describe system interfaces and expectations
