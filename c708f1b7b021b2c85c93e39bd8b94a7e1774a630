Phase 5: GITHUB-SETUP.org Integration

Prompts used (cleaned for clarity):
1. 'Show GITHUB-SETUP.org' (just 3 words)
   - Purpose: Review the GitHub integration setup file

2. 'Same process: GITHUB-SETUP.org (Last - GitHub integration)'
   - Purpose: Tangle GitHub infrastructure from org-mode

Context from original development:
- Building self-hosting Gemini REPL with formal specifications
- GitHub-specific markdown in .github/rfcs/
- CI/CD for TLA+/Alloy verification planned
- Self-modification capabilities discussed

Implementation Notes:
- YAML files had extensive trailing whitespace issues
- Created complete GitHub Actions workflow suite
- Added issue templates for bugs, features, and formal verification
- RFC process established with template
- GitHub CLI helper scripts created
- All 14 code blocks tangled successfully
- Note: No actual GitHub repository required for this structure

Files created:
- 4 workflow files (CI, docs, formal verification, release)
- 3 issue templates
- RFC process with template
- 3 helper scripts
- Pull request template
