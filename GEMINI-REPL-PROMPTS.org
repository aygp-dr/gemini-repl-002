#+AUTHOR: jwalsh + Claude
#+DATE: 2025-07-15
#+STARTUP: overview

* SINGLE-INPUT REPRODUCTION SYSTEM

This document contains EVERY ACTUAL PROMPT from git notes analysis to reproduce the Gemini REPL repository exactly. These are the real prompts that built this project, extracted from 40+ commits with detailed git notes.

** OPERATION: Start Here
1. Give AI this file: GEMINI-REPL-PROMPTS.org
2. Issue command: "CONTINUE"  
3. AI executes next phase and waits
4. Issue command: "CONTINUE"
5. Repeat until complete

** CONTINUE Control Structure
- Each "CONTINUE" advances to next phase
- AI must wait for explicit "CONTINUE" 
- No auto-advancement between phases
- Each phase ends with "READY FOR CONTINUE"

** Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- Node.js installed
- Git configured
- A text editor
- Internet connection for npm packages
- Gemini API key (will be added to .env)

* Phase 1: Repository Foundation (Wait for CONTINUE)

** Initial Vision Prompts (From git notes commit 82370be)
Execute these exact prompts in sequence:

1. =create a .envrc that loads the .env if it exists=
2. =init this repo then read SETUP.org for the next steps=
3. =use README.org=
4. =commit the current simple structure just supporting the environment support and make notes of the prompts used=
5. =use --trailer for co-author=

** Foundation Technology Prompts
From CLAUDE.md documentation, the original vision:
1. =i want to have a simple, simple console app in clojurescript that just makes calls to curl [Gemini API endpoint] but in a repl-ish format=
2. =the exit and help commands should use a slash structure=
3. =i want to start by using formal methods to describe the interfaces or expectations of the system=

** Repository Setup Commands
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir -p gemini-repl && cd gemini-repl
git init
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env.example
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
echo 'if [ -f .env ]; then source .env; fi' > .envrc
#+END_SRC

**Phase 1 Complete** → READY FOR CONTINUE

* Phase 2: SETUP.org Generation and Tangling (Wait for CONTINUE)

** SETUP.org Creation Prompt (From git notes commit f757a75)
Create a comprehensive SETUP.org file that generates the initial project structure. The file should contain org-mode source blocks that create all necessary directories and files.

Exact prompts: 
1. =git status and then tangle SETUP.org=
2. =just commit the diffs we're seeing from setup.org then we're going to rm it=
3. =use --trailer for co-author=
4. =no generated with in the body of commits=

The SETUP.org should generate:
- Complete directory structure
- Initial configuration files
- Formal specifications scaffolding
- Development environment setup

** Expected Directory Structure After Tangling
#+BEGIN_SRC
specs/           # Formal specifications
src/             # Implementation
